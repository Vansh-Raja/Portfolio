# TODO

- [ ] Add screenshots/thumbnails for the new projects and wire them into `projects.json`.
- [ ] Make project tiles clickable and route to dedicated detail pages (blog-style) with richer writeups.
- [ ] Deploy each project and add live/demo links to the project cards.
- [ ] Evaluate migrating off AstraDB/Upstash to a 24/7 alternative (e.g., managed Postgres + pgvector and managed Redis/Upstash alternative), then update env/config and embedding pipeline accordingly.
