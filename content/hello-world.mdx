Hey there!

Welcome to my blog. I'm Vansh, and this is where I'll share updates, ideas, and things I'm working on.

## What to Expect

I'll be adding blogs about all of my projects here—the thought process that went into building them, the problems I ran into, the decisions I made, and how it all came together. If you're curious about any project you see in my portfolio, there's probably a post here that dives deeper into the story behind it.

Expect posts about tech, side projects, and whatever else I find interesting along the way.

**A note on how I write these posts:**

Yes, I use AI to help compose these blogs. But the ideas, the technical decisions, the problem-solving—that's all me. I brainstorm the content, write down my thoughts, and then use AI to clean it up into something readable. I tend to ramble and make grammatical mistakes, so it helps to have something organize my thoughts into a coherent post.

If something reads a bit "AI-generated," that's just my messy brain being tidied up. The substance is mine.
