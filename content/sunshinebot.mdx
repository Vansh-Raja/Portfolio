## The Assignment

I had a week to build a conversational AI chatbot for a hospital. This was an interview assignment for an internship at Virtual Galaxy.

The spec asked for intent design, conversation flows, error handling—basically a document outlining how the bot would work. But I thought it would be cooler if they could actually call a phone number and try it themselves. So that's what I decided to build.

## Figuring Out the Approach

I started by researching how people actually build voice AI.

One option was to build everything myself—Python, LangChain, speech-to-text, an LLM, text-to-speech. I've done similar stuff before and it's definitely possible. But connecting all that to an actual phone call means setting up SIP servers and trunking, which is a whole infrastructure project on its own. That would eat up most of my week.

The other option was ElevenLabs. They have a conversational AI product with Twilio integration built in. You set up your agent, connect a phone number, and it handles all the voice stuff—interruptions, turn-taking, latency. The hard parts.

Since I only had a week and the whole point was a live phone demo, ElevenLabs made more sense. I could spend my time on the actual booking logic instead of fighting with voice infrastructure.

## How I Set Up the Backend

With the voice layer sorted, I needed to figure out the backend.

### Using Google Calendar as the Admin Interface

Hospitals need to see their appointments somewhere. Building a custom dashboard would take a while. But everyone knows how to use Google Calendar. So I made that the interface for hospital staff.

When the bot books something, it creates a calendar event. Staff can see the schedule, get reminders, move things around if needed. No learning curve.

Behind the calendar, there's a SQLite database that syncs every 60 seconds. All the conflict checks and availability lookups happen against the database since it's faster. The calendar is really just a view. If I ever needed to replace it with something custom, I'd just change what the database syncs to.

### Keeping Things Modular

The Flask API has separate endpoints that the AI agent calls as tools:

- Check if a patient exists by phone number
- Save a new patient
- Create an appointment
- List all of a patient's appointments
- Reschedule or cancel an appointment
- Check a doctor's availability for a date

Each one does one thing. The AI decides when to use them based on the conversation. This made testing easier since I could check the backend without needing the voice layer running.

## The Phone Number Situation

I wanted to use an Indian number, but that turned out to be complicated.

Getting a voice-enabled Indian number requires going through TRAI compliance and specific providers. The registration process takes longer than a week. So I just got a US number through Twilio, added an international calling pack to my phone, and called from India.

It worked fine. The bot recognized my number, looked up my info, and let me book appointments. Good enough for a demo.

## What the Bot Does

It handles the basics:

- **Recognizes callers** by phone number when they call in
- **Books appointments** — takes the specialty, date, time, checks for conflicts, creates the event
- **Lists appointments** — can answer things like "what do I have tomorrow" or "when was my last visit"
- **Reschedules** — confirms the new time, checks availability, updates everything
- **Cancels** — confirms you actually want to cancel, then removes it

Times are in IST, working hours are enforced, double-bookings don't happen. It's a working system, not just a script.

## What I'd Change With More Time

A few things I'd do differently with another week:

**Try other voice AI platforms.** I've looked into Retell, Vapi, Bland, and a few others since then. ElevenLabs worked well for this, but I'd want to compare options before building something for production.

**Build a real admin interface.** Google Calendar is a nice shortcut, but a proper dashboard would let staff do more—see patient history, add notes, handle walk-ins. The database already supports it, it's just frontend work.

**Get an Indian number properly.** With more time and budget, I'd go through the actual TRAI process and set up SIP trunking. The US number was a workaround.

## Try It Out

The phone line isn't running anymore since ElevenLabs isn't free, but the code is all here:

**GitHub:** [github.com/Vansh-Raja/SunshineBot](https://github.com/Vansh-Raja/SunshineBot)

You can clone it, add your own Google Calendar credentials and API keys, and have a working booking bot. Setup instructions are in the README.

## Wrapping Up

This was mostly about making practical choices with limited time.

ElevenLabs instead of building voice infra from scratch. Google Calendar instead of a custom dashboard. A US number instead of dealing with Indian telecom regulations.

A week, a working bot, and a phone number people could actually call. That was the goal and it worked out.
